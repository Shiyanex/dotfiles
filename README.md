# dotfiles (With each rice having their own folder so please go to the folder before cloning anything)
The dotfiles and set up (with descriptions) in the folders (and don't mind my weird way of organising as I am a newbie to git)

To install, read the readme for components then either copy the whole folder of the rice to your desktop (backup your previous desktop beforehand) or install with chezmoi (if possible as this repo is quite messy)

(Special notes such as graphical settings will be included with the rice)
